x for the add sheet to appear -- add state of the add sheet at top view level as environment variable
on sheet save, store environment is NIL?  How is AddUnit not getting the environment variable?
x sheet sets visible bool as false after cancel or save inside the view
x TurnPlan -- add button opens AddUnit
x Put add button into top view, scrollable turnplan below


NEXT
store.army - doesn't seem to update the view and remove the ArmyUnitRows that were already initialized when we shrink the array.
Fatal error: Index out of range: file



Auto save army to json file after each change
Load army on each foregrounding
change army list to just store ID of unit object but have a unit: that returns the right object -- make master 4 fields JSON serializable

FUTURE sort order list by initiative -- button to sort the column - for now, can manually call off numbers


- for order picker - change foreground overlay?  Opacity or brightness to select item?

- master unit list by Faction
- detail page for all factions
- my army builder page
- turn planning - pick orders per unit

- look at mapping order types and files to command dials -- use lookup function to walk the array and return the desired data blob?


- can views go into a picker?
- assuming we get a selected index back from picker, how to pull the order?  Change to array of orders for the dials?


- create linear picker with State variable for the selection
